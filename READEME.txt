Create a Product database that contains a list of products one might by in a store. These products should be assigned to a category.
Using WEB API, create an API to manage these products (GET, POST and DELETE at minimum. PUT can be used). You should be able to add, delete and update products.
Create a web frontend that drives the management of the products (Add, Update and Delete). The frontend should be able to filter the products shown by Category.
